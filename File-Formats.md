This page describes various file formats used by OpenSHA.

## Geospatial file formats

As of 2021, OpenSHA can save and load fault section data, regions, and gridded regions from GeoJSON. View information on those [file formats here](Geospatial-File-Formats).

## Fault System Rupture Sets & Solutions

The [UCERF3](https://wgcep.org/UCERF3) model introduced Fault System Rupture Sets and Solutions as data containers for earthquake rupture forecasts. We updated the legacy UCERF3 file formats to be more user friendly as part of the 2023 update to the U.S. National Seismic Hazard Model, replacing binary files with simpler ASCII, JSON, and GeoJSON representations.
